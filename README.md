## üßÆ SQL Queries Used (Validation Logic)

This project used Microsoft SQL Server to validate Excel calculations. Some key SQL queries include:

```sql
-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

-- Avg Order Value
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales;

-- Total Pizzas Sold
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales;

-- Total Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;

-- Avg Pizzas Per Order
SELECT CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales;
```sql
üóÇÔ∏è Additional queries for trends, category-wise sales, and filtering by time (month, quarter) are available in the project files.

## Tools Used
Excel for data cleaning, processing, pivot tables, and dashboards
SQL Server for querying and validating KPIs
Excel Charts for visualization (bar, line, pie, funnel)
PivotTables for aggregating KPIs

## Data Cleaning & Processing
Replaced pizza size abbreviations (S, M, L, XL, XXL) with readable names (Regular, Medium, Large, etc.)
Create new column order_day using =TEXT(order_date, "dddd")
Generated a unique count_order logic using:
=1 / COUNTIF(range, cell) ‚Üí to avoid duplicate order count
Final data was used in pivot tables for KPI calculations and visual charts
